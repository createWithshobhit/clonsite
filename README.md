# React + Vite


# Ochi Design Clone

This project is a clone of the [Ochi Design](https://ochi.design/) website, built to replicate its design, animations, and interactive elements using modern web technologies. The site is fully responsive and optimized for performance, featuring smooth scrolling, parallax effects, and dynamic typography.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React was used for structuring the application and creating reusable components.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server that provides an optimized workflow for modern web development. Vite was used to set up the React project.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. GSAP was used for handling complex animations.
- **Framer Motion**: A React animation library that leverages the power of the Framer design tool. Framer Motion was used to create smooth, declarative animations.
- **Locomotive Scroll**: A library for smooth scrolling and parallax effects. Locomotive Scroll was used to handle scroll-based animations and effects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-built classes for responsive design. Tailwind CSS was used for styling the application.

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented using Locomotive Scroll, which provides inertia scrolling and parallax effects for a fluid user experience.
- **Dynamic Typography**: Large, responsive text animations created with Framer Motion and GSAP.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and transitions that enhance user interaction, including custom cursors and image transformations.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast loading times and smooth performance across all modern browsers.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/createWithshobhit/clonesite
   cd clonsite
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port, depending on availability).

## Usage

- Open the project in your favorite code editor.
- Modify the components and styles as needed.
- Use the development server for live reloading during development.
- To build the project for production, run:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This will create an optimized build in the `dist` directory.
